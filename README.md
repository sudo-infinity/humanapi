# HumanApi [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/human_api.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/human_api)
A Ruby client to [HumanApi](http://humanapi.co).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
    gem 'human_api'
```
## Configuration
Let's say you have an User model as follows:
```ruby
class User<ActiveRecord::Base
	# Some attributes here
	
	def get_the_token
		# the code to reach the token
	end
end
```
Then you can do this:
```ruby
class User<ActiveRecord::Base
	# Some attributes here
	
	humanizable :get_the_token
	
	def get_the_token
		# the code to reach the token
	end
end
```
This configuration is really simple. I suggest it over the second one.

Always remember to configure the initializer with the access keys:
```ruby
HumanApi.config do |c|
	c.app_id = ENV['HUMANAPI_KEY']
	c.query_key = ENV['HUMANAPI_SECRET']
	end
```
###The alternative
If you don't like that configuration, you can use a different one, writing right into the initializer:
```ruby
HumanApi.config do |c|
	c.app_id = "<YOUR_APP_ID>"
	c.query_key = "<YOUR_QUERY_KEY>"
	
	# This is the part where the magics happen
	c.human_model = User       # Tell me what is the model you want to use
	c.token_method_name = :human_token   # Tell me the method you use to retrieve the token (Inside the human_model)
end
```
It should work in both ways, the choice is yours.

## Usage
Once you did the configuration, the usage of the gem is quite ridiculous:
```ruby
# Somewhere in your model
u = User.first
u.human.profile    #=> Will return the humanapi user's profile
u.human.query(:activities) #=> Will return everything you asked for
```
Just use the _human_ instance method from your User instance and that's it ;)

###The query method
The query method is meant to ask whatever you want whenever you want. Here are some permitted methods (according to humanapi) you can use to retrieve user's data:

	profile 
	activities
	blood_glucose
	blood_pressure
	body_fat
	genetic_traits
	heart_rate
	height
	locations
	sleeps
	weight
	bmi

Mixin' up these methods with some options will give you what you want. 
```ruby
u.human.query(:activities, :summary => true) #=> will give you a summary of the activities
u.human.query(:sleeps, :date => "2014-01-01") #=> Will give you a single sleep measurement

# Getting KPIs (KPIs are just single values you get to retrieve a measurements average value)
u.human.query(:weight) #=> Will give you a single weight value (The avg I guess)

# Getting readings (If you begin with a single avg value and you wanna go deeper)
u.human.query(:weight, :readings => true)
```
Lastly, as a common rule, I've identified a pattern in humanapis. 
- If the method name is plural, it will give you multiple measurements when calling it. In addition, you can ask for a :summary => true, for a group of value in a specific :date => "DATE" or for a single known measurement :id => "measurement_id"
- If the method name is singular, it will give you a single avg value for what you asked. In addition, you can ask for all :readings => true and for all readings => true in a specific :date=> "DATE".
- If I'm missing something just send me a PM or open an issue.
	
## Common errors and troubleshooting
###'rewrite_human_model': Could not find 'token' in User
- Causes: it does mean that the method you suggested does not exist!
- What to check: check if you misspelled the method name or the attribute does not exist.
- Solving: if this does not solve, try using the humanizable function passing a method you can create in your model to retrieve manually just the token.
